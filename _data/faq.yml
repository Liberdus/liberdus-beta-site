  question: What is self-governance? Why is it important?
  answer:
    - "Self-governance is the concept that a body of people are able to govern themselves. In other words: power to the people."
    - > 
      With many cryptocurrencies, the miners and/or the developers of the currency have too much power over the currency
      when compared to the average users of the coin. 
      Liberdus is trying to prevent this by allowing users to vote for the future they want.

      Shardus is a linearly-scaling blockchain framework that enables Liberdus to scale TPS (transactions-per-second) with the growth of the network size,

  question: Why use Liberdus over something like Ethereum? Doesn't Ethereum have more features?
  answer:
    - >
      While Ethereum may have more features like smart contracts, the benefit of Liberdus is that it is a self-sustaining 
      ecosystem that puts the coin holders in charge.
    - >
      As a holder of Liberdus, you have a right to vote on decisions that will affect the future of the coin, including features and fees. 
      You also get a network that linearly scales which means no congestion and nearly instantaneous transactions.
