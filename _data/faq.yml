  question: What is Liberdus?
  answer:
    - > 
      From a user perspective Liberdus is a simple, easy to use messaging app that protects your privacy by using end-to-end encryption and 
      a decentralized network of nodes to transfer the messages. Unlike most messaging apps the source code for Liberdus is open for anyone 
      to view and verify. Anyone can also run a Liberdus validator node to confirm that the network is truly decentralized and earn a reward 
      in the process. The Liberdus validator software uses the Shardus protocol so the network can scale easily to accommodate the load efficiently.

  question: What is Shardus?
  answer:
    - >
      Shardus is the protocol layer software to enable application specific chains. Liberdus uses the Shardus software to handle consensus 
      and data storage so the Liberdus software can focus on the application logic. The Shardus team initially developed Liberdus 
      before it was spun off as its own project.
